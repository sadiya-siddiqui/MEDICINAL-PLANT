          <h1>Termeric Medicinal Uses & Benefits</h1><br>
          <p>Turmeric is the spice that gives curry its yellow color.<br>
            It has been used in India for thousands of years as both a spice and medicinal herb.<br>
            ResearchTrusted Source has shown that turmeric<br>
             contains compounds with medicinal properties<br></p>   <br>
             <h3>1. Turmeric contains bioactive compounds with medicinal properties</h3><br>
             <p>It has powerful anti-inflammatory effectsTrusted Source and is a very strong antioxidant.<br>
                 That said, the curcumin content of turmeric is only around 1-6% by weight<br>
                Curcumin is also fat soluble, which means it breaks down and dissolves in fat or oil.<br>
                 That’s why it may be a good idea to take <br>
                 curcumin supplements with a meal that’s high in fat.</p><br>
             <h3>2. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound</h3><br>
             <p>Curcumin is a bioactive substance that can help fight inflammation, <br>
                though very high dosesTrusted Source are required to produce medicinal results.
                <br>
                Still, it means it has the potential to fight the inflammationTrusted Source<br>
                 that plays a role in many health conditions and diseases.<br>              
                That’s why anything that can help fight chronic inflammation is potentially<br>
                 important in preventing and helping treat these conditions.</p><br>
             <h3>3. Turmeric can increase the antioxidant capacity of the body</h3><br>
             <p>Oxidative damage is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and many diseases.<br>
                It involves free radicals, highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons. <br>
                Free radicals tend to react with important organic substances, <br>
                such as fatty acids, proteins, or DNA.<br>
                Curcumin is a potent antioxidant that can neutralize<br>
                 free radicalsTrusted Source due to its chemical structure.</p><br>
             <h3>4. Curcumin can boost brain-derived neurotrophic factor</h3><br>
             <p>Even in adulthood, brain neurons are capable of forming new connections,<br>
                 and in certain areas of the brain, they can multiply and increase in number.<br>
                One of the main drivers of this process is brain-derived neurotrophic factor <br>
                (BDNF), which plays a role in memory and learning, and it can be found in areas of<br>
                 the brain responsible for eating, drinking, and body weight.</p><br>
             <h3>5. Curcumin may lower your risk of heart disease</h3><br>
             <p>Heart disease is the number oneTrusted Source cause of death in the world.<br>
                 ResearchTrusted Source suggests that curcumin may help<br>
                  protect against many steps in the heart disease process.<br>
                Specifically, it helps improve the function of the endotheliumTrusted<br>
                 Source or the lining of your blood vessels.</p><br>
             <h3>6. Turmeric may help prevent cancer</h3><br>
             <p>Many different forms of cancer appear to be<br>
                 affected by curcumin supplementsTrusted Source.<br>
                In fact, curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb<br>
                 in cancer treatmentTrusted Source and has been found to affect cancer growth and development.<br>
                Studies have shown that it can:<br>
                contribute to the death of cancerous cells<br>
                reduce angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors)<br>
                reduce metastasis (spread of cancer)<br>
                There is also evidenceTrusted Source that curcumin may prevent <br>
                cancer from occurring in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system like colorectal cancer.<br>
                </p><br>
             <h3>7. Curcumin may be useful in treating Alzheimer’s disease
            </h3><br>
             <p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to up to 70% of dementia casesTrusted Source.<br>
                It’s known that inflammation and oxidative damage play a role in Alzheimer’s <br>
                disease, and curcumin has been found to have beneficial effectsTrusted Source on both.</p><br>
             <h3>8. Arthritis patients respond well to curcumin supplements</h3><br>
             <p>In a studyTrusted Source on people with osteoarthritis, <br>
                curcumin appeared to be more effective in relieving pain than a placebo,<br>
                 and researchTrusted Source has also found its effect to be <br>
                 similar to that of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<br>
                In another study on rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin appeared <br>
                to have helped reduce disease-related inflammation.<br>
                That said, more study is needed to understand if curcumin can <br>
                actually replace such drugs as a treatment for arthritis inflammation pain.
                </p><br>
             <h3>9. Curcumin has benefits against depression</h3><br>
             <p>Curcumin has shown some promise in treating mood disorders. <br>
                Its positive effects on the brain include boosting the brain neurotransmitters<br>
                 serotonin and dopamine, reducing inflammation, and encouraging brain plasticity.<br>
                  This suggests the herb may beTrusted Source an effective antidepressant.<br>
                  Depression is also linked to reduced levels of BDNF and a <br>
                  shrinking hippocampus, a brain area with a role in learning and memory.<br>
                   Curcumin can help boost BDNF levelsTrusted Source, potentially reversing some of these changes.</p><br>
             <h3>10. Curcumin may help delay aging and fight age-related chronic diseases</h3><br>
             <p>If curcumin can really help prevent heart disease, cancer,<br>
                 and Alzheimer’s, it may have benefits for longevity as well.<br>
                This suggests that curcumin may have potential as an anti-aging supplement.<br>
                Given that oxidation and inflammation are believed to play a roleTrusted Source in aging,<br>
                 curcumin may have effects that go way beyond just preventing disease.
