            <h1>Castor Benefits & Medicinal Uses</h1><br>
            <h3>1. A powerful laxative</h3>
            <p>Castor oil is well-known for its use as a natural laxative <br>
                 and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose. <br>
                It works quickly by stimulating muscle movement  <br>
                in the intestines, making it effectiveTrusted Source for <br>
                 temporary constipation relief or bowel cleansing before medical procedures. <br>
                  However, using too much castor oil can have negative <br>

                </p>
                <h3>2. A natural moisturizer</h3>
                <p>Castor oil is rich in ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid  <br>
                    known for its moisturizing propertiesTrusted Source. <br>
                     It can be used alone or with other oils as a natural alternative to store-bought moisturizers. <br>
                    Unlike commercial products, it contains no harmful additives and is suitable for the face and body. <br>
                     However, it may cause allergic reactionsTrusted Source in some individuals, <br>
                      so always dilute it with a carrier oil like coconut oil before using it, <br>
                     and do a small skin patch test first before using it on larger skin areas. <br></p>
                     <h3>3. May promote wound healing</h3>
                     <p>Castor oil can help promote wound healing by  <br>
                        creating a moist environment and preventing drying out. <br>
                        Additionally, ricinoleic acid, the main fatty acid found in castor oil, <br>
                         may help reduceTrusted Source skin inflammation, support healing, <br>
                         and aid in pain reduction in people with wounds. <br></p>
                         <h3>4. May be helpful for cleaning and storing dentures</h3>
                         <p>A number of bacteria and fungi, including Candida fungi, commonly grow on dentures.  <br>
                            This can create oral concerns if dentures arenâ€™t properly cleaned and stored. <br>
                            Candida species, like C. albicans, are especially problematic for people who wear <br>
                             dentures because they easily adhereTrusted Source to denture surfaces and mouth tissues. <br>
                            An overgrowth of Candida fungi can lead to a condition called denture stomatitis, <br>
                             an infection that leads to inflammation, redness, and irritation in the mouth. <br></p>
